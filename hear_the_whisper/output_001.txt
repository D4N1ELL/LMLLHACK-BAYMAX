And its thereley accenting.
So.
Now I wanted to make a cool melody
Thank you.
Thank you guys.
Just a sound source
from the ISO side.
I'm going to make you look
quite as noisy as a裡 of tremolo.
No.
One of your tremolo
and the previous video,
Just goשה and do your best, remove yourplatjach
and then climb up your stance,
clear up the ramp up.
So what I do here
preserve the various picovesices
and the fuerte choice
and also what you click on back
which is an amazing example.
Until it shows for example
and then I go to my drum staging
here on the weekly drum kit
I think that's the end
When we do that, we do it again.
Okay cool. That's a cool.
A bit of a garage beat.
I'm looking at it again.
It's a swing groove.
It's a bit of a swing drill.
There you can see it.
There you can see it.
I think we can check it out.
It's a bit of a fade out.
A bit of a fade out.
A bit of a swing groove.
Let's copy it again.
We can see it again.
It's a bit of a bit busy.
And maybe with a frequency shift.
It's a bit of a hook or underpitched.
The film is actually...
For example, it's really nice to have a shower.
Or a bathroom.
And then water comes in and it's completely in the water.
And it's just a little bit of a wash.
But also, it's very clean.
It's a bit of a wash.
It's a thing that we often feel here.
It's a good thing for a half a year.
You can just sit and see it.
And I'm going to wash it with the wash.
And also the clean from the door.
It's a little bit of a waste of time.
So, it's a bit of a waste of time.
So, I can say, it's a long time with transposition.
We can see that it's in the door and out of the rest here.
And then I have a couple of tools to use.
To use it is actually something as natural as it is.
And it's actually a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a rush to shift.
So, I'm going to do a resonator exercise.
That's a bit of a practice.
A grand vacuum filter that you just noticed that you will appear on the ground.
Which is clearly found in the itimq laser completely.
And this goes from here to that.
And what does it have to do with that?
Ah!
Because you see the tone of the ESS, of course not a perfect C,
it has to be of course not really a step.
But you can do everything different.
But we are in parallel with the tone of the ESS, OK.
It's a difference in the ESS.
And now I have an idea for chords.
I want to find a drop for the intro,
with this graph, it's a very cool one.
But for the drop, we have a half-time track.
It's like half-time fast,
and it's a bit too long, but at the same time,
if you have a faster track, it's still a bit more energy.
And now I have my synthies, the software of my intro,
the range of the range of the sound, the practice,
the same as the analog synthesizer,
just in detail.
And that's why I always use my great range,
to do some analog synths,
instead of sound, we see in original script,
with all this sound, a 3x speed kick,
and the gain by MesieGo.
So now, I'm really interested in the track stage,
and can explain it up a bit,
so I'm very impressed with the track with the daily increase of morale
because I want to correct the sound from those who never met忘eness.
It's not, but it's just to click on it, I think.
Here's a little triangle.
And now we're not trialling.
But it's really important that you make a mistake.
So, now that's not a static click,
that's not a click, that's the loudstack.
Of course, and that's also for this filter, that's a bit...
I'd really like to say that,
which has already been written before,
in the music production,
that there are only one synthesizer output,
because all of which could be connected,
or the same parameters,
which are just really studied.
One synthesizer output,
then you have the first phase,
and you understand that,
and you know that it's so good,
and the library, that you always have to know about it,
so you know how to click,
and how to come up with it.
Because otherwise, you have to click,
and you just have to know,
you know,
you have to download it,
and it's one of the things you study,
then it's also very, very large for many situations.
So, here's our plug,
and I'll do this a little bit better,
with a...
Yeah, where is the code,
so you can click like this a little bit.
I'll do this here,
and then I'll add a filter,
and then there's also a filter,
as well as a filter,
but then there's one frequency,
with a lot of resonance,
click like this,
and that's...
but if you want to know something,
what is the tonal to pass?
Well,
as in the next number of 12,
and
as in the next number of 12,
and
as in the next number of 12,
and that's it,
because it's a little bit more
and a little bit more
and a little bit more.
So,
the first project that I'm going to project
is my name,
because there's a change,
for 2 and a fine.
I need...
the 3 and a fine.
So I'll name it,
so I'll give you...
and we'll
keep dans compromise,
we'll get together,
that's it.
I'll do it again,
that's alright.
