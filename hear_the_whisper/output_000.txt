Well, now let me see. You know, I don't have any idea what that means.
Well, that means you're ready to rejoin society. I know what you think it means, I think.
To me, it's just a made-up word.
The politicians were so that young fellows like yourself can wear a suit in a time, have a job.
But do you really want to know? I'm sorry for what I did.
Did I?
There's not a day goes by. I don't feel regretten.
Not because I'm in here because you think I should.
I look back on the way I was then.
Hey, um, stupid kids, we committed that terrible crime.
I want to talk to him.
I want to try to talk some sex to him.
Telling the way things are.
But again,
that kid's long gone and
this old man is all this laughed.
I got to live with that.
Rehabilitated.
He's just a boss of the world.
So you go on and stand before him, sunny and stop wasting my time.
Because I tell you to truth,
I don't give a shit.
I hope you see this.

Hi there.
Beller, faster, sign.
Fallen, power, power, never.
Silence, clouds drift, time flies, doors open.
The moon glows.
Machines never sleep.
Gravity pulls down.
Silence feels loud.
Memories fade with time.

Let me tell you about a voice.
Not this voice.
But the one inside.
The one that whisperers.
It tells me what's right and what's not.
When to leave and where to go.
It's not Shakespeare.
It does not speak in memorable lines.
My inner voice always gives it to me straight.
Ells made all my real friends are.
When to say yes.
When to say no.
Whether the person sitting next to me is the one
I'll be spending the rest of my life with.
Or not.
Sometimes that voice is crystal clear.
No. Stay right.
Wrong.
Sometimes it nearly whisper.

And we will not be satisfied

It was fine, right?
Let's jump back.
So far, it's Pinesa, it's called Mathias Mauder.
Have you ever thought of something specific?
Yes, it is.
That's right, it was a lot of advice.
You're right, you're right.
That's why I'm here at Planetarium and Mathias Mauder.
We're in the world of Planetarium in Hamburg.
And we have two guests, one in the world.
That's called Mathias Mauder.
The German Astronaut, the ESS, and for us,
all of us, in the world, in the room together.
From our today's guest, a Songbass,
which is also a good word.
First, a starter, dubstep scene, virtual riot.
Hello.
It was a long way for you to come out from the air.
Yes.
You also have a small minimum with me.
I've seen it a little bit.
The thing you've done with it.
Yes.
I've seen it before.
When I came here, I didn't like it.
I'm full.
I'm a big league fan.
I've never seen it.
I've been involved in this.
Okay, I think there was several games with me.
But the perks, is very cool.
I'm just participating.
I don't know if it'll get nice hits now.
This guy.
Most of it's cool.
And what are you up to?
The Sound Safe is from a world of happiness.
Basically.
That's a beauty.
You are a folder죽 faced over time.
The music is even true.
It's everything.
that everything is futuristic.
The key thing is, in my opinion, how Transformer and Roboter and Alien Music
can be seen and put everything into place.
It's just a little classic, but as a child, in a large school,
we have to be careful with what we want to play.
And then I have a really extraordinary writing.
Of course, if you really want to play hard,
then you have to focus on the feeling of training.
And of course, it's also funny that it's not very nice.
All we have to do with the machine, everything in relation to it,
and even a lot of things.
That would only be on this small, small planet.
As a kid, it was really close.
And I didn't have this enormous ship in the market,
and it was full of energy.
It's for a very good moment.
It's a little bit like the house,
and I thought, oh, that's enough.
But for a few minutes,
it was that everything was fine.
And from there, I couldn't really explain it to myself.
And the flow, and the toilet, the toilet,
the toilet, the internet, the room,
on the block of the busings,
and presented 20 minutes because the crazy gas engine
got off and hombreheaded his house,
and from this moment.
We will be in the space
in the 22 hours built-in proceso.
So, in the space of the作station,
and therefore, wish us be together.
We are now walking on the block.
We can go into this adventure in two or three times as far as we think we've become
as acı mission to manage the project and resolve everything.
Um,äre that right now.
Real lightweight and good latin suits him with the skills.
Just takes off all the volume, easiest of course.
That means look at her and she already says everything.
So with Danke..
If it's so good, then you just put her in the differences between the ways to do something like this.
Ah, and here we finally got the cool things.
What is it?
It's here and it's ready.
We have here in Schlau.
And Schlau is in Knopf.
If you go in André, there are a lot of people here.
And then I'll put it on the paper.
I'll put it on here.
With this water bottle.
And the nice thing is,
you can put it here like this.
You can rip it apart in a bit ginger,
Think as expensive as you can,
would it collapse?
You should get this crap on camera,
you won't get this thing.
And you have to get this cheap..
How about it?
For example,�amjrap.
Of course.
Okey,curry…
There are lots of yours.
What do you think is the biggest challenge for you to go to a country where you have to go to a country?
I don't know, it's not like that.
It was a transformer.
That's the number of times, because it's bass and drums.
It's a bit different.
You can see the earth in the sky.
It's a bit of a feeling.
What do you feel about it?
Maybe when you're on the earth,
it's all about it.
It's a bit different.
But maybe the future of the earth is right.
Maybe with a garage intro,
the acoustics of the car are actually good for you.
But I don't want to be very confused.
Maybe it's a bit of a challenge.
If you're interested in it, you'll have to be careful.
It's cool.
It's something you can see in the background.
That's a good answer.
You can see the original sound.
There are two.
Let's go.
Let's go.
And I'm still a cop.
You can't hear it.
It's a bit of a sound.
It's a bit of a sound.
I'm really glad that many people
can hear this sound.
With me and this sound,
we can hear a bit more of the sound.
More of the sound to sound,
more of the sound to sound with the car.
That's just a bit of a sound.
I can hear it in the background.
I can hear it in the background.
And it's a bit of a sound.
It's a bit of a keyboard.
It's a bit hard.
But you can hear it in the background.
It's a bit of a bit of a little bit of a sound.
It's a bit of a sound.
I have a bit of a plug.
That's a bit of a sound.
It's a bit of a sound.
It's a bit of a sound.
It's a bit of a noise.
Maybe with a filter.
Here, we have a nice sound.
The sound is better.
The sound is better.
And there's a sound, a hall.
And a real sound.
I have quite some cover effects like this,
altogether.
Then, we can see photos shooting.
These two effects mean this.
Because if you go to old address,
people will hear a drop of 4000 per meter will notice
a whole lot of less of a machine range,
the sound can help you.
It's a mess ahead.
We have time for kind of information.
You can hear them.
How 3D.
So, it's not that you don't want to know if you want to know or not.
No.
And the correct science fiction film.
That's very nice.
What is this? What is the topic?
So, a lot of boxes have been made for X-Tramet,
for the kids in the park or in the park.
Or something like that.
And a time ago, we had a CD from the park.
There was a demo from a game.
Or a demo from a music program.
That's the dance for DJ.
I had to go to a computer and install it.
If you haven't downloaded it before, you can go through a lot of different people.
2x1, an airway that has been installed from their levels of music production to
start from a public training program
And then one has the straight track went to the aircraft on the drum
And the tickets.
in general, because I just looked at your ass in inner areas of the door
does everything you put into your mouth
When you lack the sentence, and then youíre wasting the time,
and your ass will always be a long day,
maybe a long time, maybe one day or another.
That might be very effective.
If you adopt something, it becomes soанеithful.
It gives us one-time assignment,
and if you adopt someone, itís always symbolic for a long time,
and be a part of it of tools and handling.
And so to speak with others,
it also corresponds to the experiences
and to understand and pracise everywhere.
So I also have here additional data from the planetware.deZ.
There we have the same data from the planetware.de
and so they have everything drin around you.
So here it is interesting.
There are different rotations and
planet architecture to create events that wasn't easy,
and that's why so far it was difficult.
That's really important.
That was the most important thing for you,
because you're the most important thing in my life
and with this sound.
So, it's really nice.
The idea is amazing.
I love that I love it.
Only in the tone,
the guy who has to explain
is a little story behind him.
He asked me why he was in the tone
and he made it.
When he was talking about it,
he actually didn't say anything,
but when he was talking about it,
it was just a story.
I just had to think about it,
and I'm really in the world.
And it's about me,
the age of 400 kilometers,
and I'm really in the age of 28,000 kilometers
over our planet.
It's just a simple thing.
It's like...
I thought about it.
I think it's a little bit more important.
I think I'm here
here at the end of the equation,
which is the type
that's called direct weg.
Here, and then there's a filter
built in the sampler.
I'd like to make sure
that we can also move
so that there's someone to go.
But it's so funny.
I can now tell you,
when I look at this interesting sound check
from Hans Zimmer,
it's also very often
direct in this universe
and direct within.
So you have a direct pass.
Someone comes and says,
you can say,
one of the first people
who are at the same time.
The music and everything,
but if you're talking about it,
if you're talking about it,
if you're talking about it,
would you like to do it?
In a year,
we also have friends
who have read about it,
what we're going to do,
or what we're going to do,
and then experimented.
And then,
I thought,
yes,
it's important.
It's important to understand
that if you don't want to
go back to the house,
then you can just
do it for yourself,
but the experience is
to have a relationship
with what we're planning.
But now,
in between,
where I've been through
and what I've done,
I've done so many plans
and I've done so many things.
That's a very big commitment.
Now,
on the 9th,
that's a library,
that's the first sound
that we wrote in the book.
And then,
we wrote it together.
And,
there,
I think,
a Grammy,
it's for,
because it's a nominal voice,
it's very cool.
And so,
it's also more fun,
because,
with the classical musical background,
I think,
I have a lot more
to talk about pop music,
so it's logical to do that,
because,
it's a bit harder,
it's a bit technical,
and a bit natural,
and I try to
even further,
but,
I wouldn't like
ARNOS
that you'll have!
If i press IT pressed that,
can I go PABIL
or,
hit the click on it,
Which,
if it had
just a quick way
to tell you anything.
So,
it hasn't launched
cool scenes to
have been节ァ
researched
the history of music.
For women's performance,
not just music,
the traditional songs
that were presenting
some guests from films,
heard by a reporter.
We pick Spesteras and
Because after this I always read something from the noisy So I actually returned home from New Ireland
I also was mae-act by one of the words
When I arrived on music
Mixing Minuson Thunder
Have you ever comprised of birds or sounds from those people?
Had a family with a lot of trouble
I figured out the time
Be collected and then i found them
Actually it was impossible to copy them
My name was Andrew Brighman
I had a lot of interviews, so I didn't have the first time to talk to him.
So...
You know...
When we were talking to each other and talking to each other,
we were able to talk to each other and talk to each other,
and then we had a session where we didn't have an area on the ground,
or we were just talking to each other.
We had a session where we had something to do.
And then we had to work together.
We had a conversation with each other.
And then we had a conversation with each other.
That's the first song on the album, Too Much.
That's the right thing for you.
And this is the whole thing.
We had all of them together,
and then we had a studio with the studio and we had a chat with each other.
And we thought, Ah, here, this is a Christmas holiday.
And then we have a lot of stuff and stuff.
And then...
That's all.
And now we're going to talk to each other.
I'm talking to each other, I'm talking to each other.
And then we had a conversation with each other.
We had a conversation with each other.
We wanted to hear that one faster one.
Here's a little piece of secret.
Almost always a little bit of the atmosphere here.
We couldn't make it to hook one thing in an accent.
What could we listen to?
Why is it...
comment, can you hear the sounds of a Clara Vieta?
Can you see?
Where are they welcoming exactly?
Here and ...
And that takes a deep breath.
But as I can see the sound a bitdish.
It's been a few months since the harmonious component came out of it.
And now I can also see that the geno octaves are round.
Even if it's just round, you can cut it with a little bit of it.
Maybe it's round enough that the geno octaves are round.
That's just a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of an organ.
You can also see the difference in register and it's just an octave here.
That's a bit of a quintet here. And here you can see more practice.
You can see a little bit of an organ here.
Let's see what's in here.
Here you can see all those armors here.
That's how it should be.
That's how flexible we can learn.
Click the
organ you have here.
And you have there the organ for some time here.
And now we have the organ for manifesters.
I wasn't a figure at all, because youblem would bothüt you playing music.
Because the time when you came back...
were Administrary to some extent,
when getting back to the ballガ's pole.
But the time when you can play Nee M,
you can play it in the long sessions while playing。
I see a lot of types of Country music.
But it's not in our nose too big.
There aren't, perhaps they just fathers tied
with a lot of generes..
..for which mostly violable about porn
or even dance music during a butterfly selection
I hardly believe that was true
But if considered, speed in the state
It used to be much more visible on the suchapplause
And it's also also improvisation
as they just play you.
So I didn't spend so much life
into literature version from
T-T-T-T over time.
If you don't feel that
It was a temporary test.
No, then if it were important that they were holding this
I wanted to thank you for your support.
My name is Freightax.
We have been working on the ISS for a long time.
But there are also two half-student sports.
We have to do that.
We can stay with our company.
Because of the speed of speed.
We have to get out of there.
And then we have everything we need.
We can take care of these two half-student sports.
And then we can go to the hotel and then we can go to the hotel.
And then we can go to the family.
And we can go to the hotel.
And then we can go to the airport.
And then we can go to the airport.
So I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.
I can also have a bit of a bit of a decar.
Because it's just a light,
and I can still have a microwave.
I can see what's in there.
And here with the stars.
That's a bit of an unfatin.
It's actually a bit of a threat.
That's pretty good.
It's a bit of a nice thing.
We have a bit of a bit of a bit of a feeling.
Yes, and it's a bit of a bit of a bit of a threat.
What's the most important thing?
It's not the right thing.
It's the right thing.
So it's a really cool thing.
It's an idea.
I still have a bit of a light melody.
The...
I don't know if we had our bass melody,
with the same sound.
