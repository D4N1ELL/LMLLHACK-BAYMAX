divided into 32 smaller pieces usinf ffmpeg
used jupyter colab for better processing power and used the open-ai library called whisper with tiny
after 3 failed attempts switched to model turbo
data is much clearer now
found 5 letters DIOMGI by using ctrl+f by searching "keyword" using the template provided in the task

# Audio Keyword Extraction Process

## 1. Audio Preparation
- Obtained the full audio file.
- Divided the audio into 32 smaller pieces using `ffmpeg` for easier processing.

## 2. Transcription
- Used Google Colab for increased processing power.
- Utilized the OpenAI Whisper library:
	- Initially tried the `tiny` model (3 failed attempts).
	- Switched to the `turbo` model for better accuracy and clarity.
- The transcribed data was much clearer with the `turbo` model.

## 3. Keyword Search
- Searched for hidden letters using the template provided in the task (e.g., "The first letter in keyword is ...").
- Used `Ctrl+F` to search for the word "keyword" in the transcript files.
- Successfully found 5 letters: **D I O M G I**.

## 4. Final Letter Discovery
- The last letter (**S**) was found by brute force, as it could not be located in the transcript files despite multiple search attempts.
